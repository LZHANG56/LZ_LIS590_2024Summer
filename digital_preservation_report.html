            <h2>Digital Preservation Report</h2>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This report outlines the digital preservation techniques implemented to ensure the longevity and integrity of the Chinese and Korean religious studies collections at the Digital Theological Library (DTL).</p>
            
            <h3>Preservation Techniques</h3>
            
            <h4>1. Format Selection</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preferred Formats:</strong> PDF/A, TIFF, WAV</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> These formats are widely recognized for their stability and long-term readability.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>2. Storage Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Primary Storage:</strong> Secure cloud storage with automated backups.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Storage:</strong> Physical external hard drives stored in a climate-controlled environment.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>3. Metadata Documentation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Inclusion of Preservation Metadata:</strong> Metadata such as creation date, format version, and preservation actions taken are recorded to ensure future accessibility and understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>4. Regular Audits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Bi-annual audits of digital collections.</li>
                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Verification of file integrity, metadata accuracy, and storage conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>5. Redundancy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Copies:</strong> At least three copies of each digital asset are maintained in geographically dispersed locations to prevent data loss due to localized disasters.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            
            <h4>Training</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> DTL staff were trained in digital preservation best practices, including format selection, metadata documentation, and audit procedures.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Pilot Project</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Phase:</strong> Applied preservation techniques to a subset of the collections to assess effectiveness and identify potential issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Based on the pilot project's success, techniques were refined and applied to the broader collection.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            
            <h4>Challenge 1: Format Obsolescence</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Regularly review and update formats to ensure compatibility with current technology.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Challenge 2: Metadata Consistency</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented automated tools to check for metadata consistency and completeness.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Challenge 3: Storage Costs</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Utilized a combination of cloud and physical storage to balance cost and accessibility.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            
            <h4>Continuous Improvement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Training:</strong> Regular workshops for staff on new digital preservation techniques.</li>
                <li><strong>Technology Updates:</strong> Monitor advancements in digital preservation technology and update practices accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Community Engagement</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Outreach Programs:</strong> Engage with the community to gather feedback on the preservation efforts and incorporate their input into future plans.</li>
            </ul>

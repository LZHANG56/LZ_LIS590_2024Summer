- **Webinars by the Internet Archive:**
  - Attended “Archive 101” and “Archive 201” webinars to enhance skills in navigating and utilizing the Internet Archive.
  - Learned advanced search techniques and strategies for finding specific resources within the archive.

## Key Learnings
- **Evaluating Repositories:** Improved ability to assess the value and relevance of various open access repositories for inclusion in DTL’s collections.
- **Advanced Search Techniques:** Gained advanced search skills from the Internet Archive webinars, enabling more efficient and targeted resource discovery.

## Challenges
- **Managing Resource Volume:** Managing and prioritizing the large volume of available open access resources to select the most relevant ones for the collections.

## Next Steps
- **Add Selected Resources:** Begin adding selected open access materials from evaluated repositories to DTL’s collections.
- **Document Evaluation Process:** Document and reflect on the process of evaluating and selecting resources for future reference and improvement.

## Examples
- **Evaluating Repositories:** For instance, I evaluated repositories such as the Directory of Open Access Books and the Directory of Open Access Journals. Additionally, I examined Chinese language repositories and Korean language resources. For example, I explored the Hong Kong University thesis database, which provided valuable academic resources related to Chinese and Korean religious studies. I assessed their relevance and potential contribution to DTL’s collections and identified several valuable resources to add. I documented the process and criteria used to select these repositories for future reference and consistency.

- **Verification and Addition:** I verified the titles, authors, and publication dates of the resources I found in these repositories. For example, I added dissertations from the Hong Kong University thesis database to our collection by ensuring their metadata matched the standards required by DTL and OCLC. This meticulous verification ensured the accuracy and reliability of the resources added to our collections.

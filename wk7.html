            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ensuring Non-overlap:</strong> Ensuring that new collections did not overlap with existing ones required careful and thorough analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintaining Metadata Quality:</strong> Maintaining high standards of metadata accuracy and consistency across all entries was time-consuming but essential.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>

                <li><strong>Promote the Collections:</strong> Plan and execute outreach activities to promote the new collections to the academic community.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adding More Titles:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Title Addition Process:</strong> Added several new titles to the DTL OA Chinese Literature Studies collection, such as dissertations on the influence of Confucianism in Chinese literature and comprehensive studies on modern Chinese poetry. Each entry included detailed metadata verified against sources like the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI).</li>
                        <li><strong>Detailed Metadata Entry:</strong> For example, one entry included a thesis on the historical development of Chinese religious literature, with metadata fields such as Title, Author(s), Publication Date, and URLs meticulously filled out.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Overlap Check and Specificity Verification:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exploring Existing Collections:</strong> Explored other DTL collections to identify any potential overlaps.

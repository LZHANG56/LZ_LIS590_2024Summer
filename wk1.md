**Date:** June 15 - 21, 2024

## Activities

  - Explored the OCLC’s WorldShare Management Services (WMS) interface.
  - Navigated the Digital Theological Library’s catalog search page for better usage.

- **Adding Titles to an Existing Collection:**
  - **Metadata Tab and Collection Manager:** Navigated to the Metadata tab and selected the Collection Manager.
  - **Search for Collection:** Searched for the “HathiTrust World Access with no download restrictions” collection and viewed existing titles.
  - **Search and Verification:** Conducted searches for religious studies titles in various languages to ensure they were not already included in the collection. Verified titles by comparing the HathiTrust document with the WorldCat catalog record, focusing on Title, Author(s), and Publication date.

## Key Learnings
- **Understanding WMS Interface:** Gained a solid understanding of OCLC’s WMS functionalities and navigation.
- **Verifying and Adding Titles:** Improved skills in cross-referencing titles between HathiTrust and WorldCat to ensure accurate additions to the collection.

## Challenges
- **Metadata Discrepancies:** Faced initial challenges in matching titles due to slight discrepancies in metadata entries between HathiTrust and WorldCat.

## Next Steps
- **Continue Adding Titles:** Proceed with adding more titles to the existing HathiTrust collection.
- **Explore Other Repositories:** Begin exploring additional repositories to find more relevant titles for the DTL collections.

## Examples
- **Successfully Added Title:** For instance, I successfully added an eBook resource to the DTL library collection after checking the HathiTrust document with the WorldCat catalog record. I verified the title, author(s), and publication date to ensure accuracy before adding the title, which resulted in the red circle with a slash changing to a green checkmark.

# Digital Collections on Chinese and Korean Religious Studies at the DTL sponsored by OCLC - DFW work on 2024 Summer at UW

Welcome to Luming Zhang's Directed Fieldwork Experience Repository! This repository contains all relevant artifacts from my fieldwork at the Digital Theological Library (DTL), where I focused on developing and managing digital collections in Chinese and Korean religious studies. This repository serves as both a professional portfolio of my work and a detailed record of the tasks performed, outcomes achieved, and knowledge gained during my internship.

## Learning Outcomes

This Directed Fieldwork was structured around several key learning outcomes:

1. **Metadata Schema Development:** Developed a specialized metadata schema to enhance cataloging and retrieval of religious texts.
2. **Digital Preservation Techniques:** Implemented digital preservation methods to ensure the longevity of digital collections.
3. **Collection Management:** Mastered the use of OCLC's knowledge base for managing digital collections effectively.
4. **Intercultural Communication:** Enhanced communication with diverse communities to ensure the accuracy and cultural relevance of the collections.
5. **Community Engagement:** Conducted seminars and workshops to raise awareness and use of the new collections.

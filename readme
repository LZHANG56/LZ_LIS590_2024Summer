Welcome to Luming's Directed Fieldwork Experience Repository! This repository contains all relevant artifacts from my fieldwork at the Digital Theological Library (DTL), where I focused on developing and managing digital collections in Chinese and Korean religious studies. This repository serves as both a professional portfolio of my work and a detailed record of the tasks performed, outcomes achieved, and knowledge gained during my internship.

## Learning Outcomes

1. **Metadata Schema Development:** Developed a specialized metadata schema to enhance cataloging and retrieval of religious texts.
2. **Digital Preservation Techniques:** Implemented digital preservation methods to ensure the longevity of digital collections.
3. **Collection Management:** Mastered the use of OCLC's knowledge base for managing digital collections effectively.
4. **Intercultural Communication:** Enhanced communication with diverse communities to ensure the accuracy and cultural relevance of the collections.
5. **Community Engagement:** Conducted seminars and workshops to raise awareness and use of the new collections.
